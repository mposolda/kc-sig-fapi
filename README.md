## How to run FAPI Conformance suite with Keycloak server in your local machine

### Software requirements

* [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* JDK and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Run FAPI Conformance suite, Keycloak server and Test Runner

Edit `hosts` file as per the [Modify your hosts file](#Modify-your-hosts-file) section

This repository contains default self-signed certificates for HTTPS, client private keys, Keycloak Realm JSON and FAPI Conformance suite config JSONs.
If you would like to use the configurations as it is, you only need to build and boot all the containers using Docker Compose.

Run the following command from the project basedir to start the test suite

```
docker-compose -p keycloak-fapi up --build
```
The OpenID FAPI Conformance test interface will then be reachable at [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).
See instructions in [Run FAPI Conformance test plan](#Run-FAPI-Conformance-test-plan) 
section for running the tests manually in your browser.

To stop all containers after the automated tests have run:

```
docker-compose -p keycloak-fapi up --build --exit-code-from test_runner
```

The following options can be set as environment variables before the above command:

* `KEYCLOAK_BASE_IMAGE` (default: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:12.0.1)
    * The keycloak image version used in the test suite
* `KEYCLOAK_REALM_IMPORT_FILENAME` (default: realm.json)
    * The keycloak realm import filename. Set this to `realm.json` if you are running the tests
    against a local build of keycloak.
* `AUTOMATE_TESTS` (default: true)
    * Set to false to stop conformance-suite tests automatically running
* `MVN_HOME` (default: ~/.m2)
    * Set to use a custom maven home path
* `OPENID_GIT_TAG` (default: release-v4.1.4)
    * The OpenID Conformance Suite Git Tag to be cloned    


**Example:**
```
KEYCLOAK_BASE_IMAGE=jboss/keycloak:6.0.1 docker-compose -p keycloak-fapi up --build
```

To stop and remove all containers, run the following:
```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Test Reports

Once `test_runner` service has finished and exited, test reports will be copied to the 
[./conformance-suite/report](./report) directory.


### Modify your `hosts` file

To access to Keycloak and Resource server with FQDN, modify your `hosts` file in your local machine as follows.

```
127.0.0.1 as.keycloak-fapi.org rs.keycloak-fapi.org conformance-suite.keycloak-fapi.org
```

### Run FAPI Conformance test plan manually

TODO:mposolda : NOTE ABOUT CLEANUP SESSION AFTER "fapi1-advanced-final-user-rejects-authentication" (3rd test)

1. Run this project with `AUTOMATE_TESTS=false` environment variable set
2. Open https://conformance-suite.keycloak-fapi.org
3. Click `Create a new test plan` button.
4. Choose `FAPI-RW-ID2 (and OpenBankingUK): Authorization server test (latest version)` as Test Plan.
5. Choose `Client Authentication Type` you want to test.
6. Choose `plain_fapi` as FAPI Profile.
7. Choose `plain_response` as FAPI Response Mode.
8. Click `JSON` tab and paste content of the configuration.
  * If you want to use private_key_jwt client authentication, use [fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-private-key-PS256-PS256.json](./fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-private-key-PS256-PS256.json) or [fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-private-key-ES256-ES256.json](./fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-private-key-ES256-ES256.json).
  * If you want to use mtls client authentication, use [fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-mtls-PS256-PS256.json](./fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-mtls-PS256-PS256.json) or [fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-mtls-ES256-ES256.json](./fapi-conformance-suite-configs/fapi-rw-id2-with-mtls-ES256-ES256.json).
9. Click `Create Test Plan` button and follow the instructions. To proceed with the tests, You can authenticate using `john` account with password `john`. When rejecting authentication scenario, you can use `mike` account with password `mike`. In this case, you need to click `No` button to cancel the authentication in the consent screen.


## For Developers

**Currently, generators of all configurations are written with bash script and some CLI tools for linux-amd64.**

Run `generate-all.sh` script simply to generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS, client private keys, Keycloak Realm JSON and FAPI Conformance suite config JSONs.

```
./generate-all.sh
```

Now, you can boot a Keycloak server with new configurations.

```
docker-compose -p keycloak-fapi up --force-recreate
```

## Run FAPI Conformance test against local built keycloak

If you would like to run FAPI Conformance test against local built keycloak, modify `docker-compose.yml` as follows.

```
@@ -28,6 +28,7 @@ services:
      - ./https/server.pem:/etc/x509/https/tls.crt
      - ./https/server-key.pem:/etc/x509/https/tls.key
      - ./https/client-ca.pem:/etc/x509/https/client-ca.crt
+     - <path to locally built keycloak>:/opt/jboss/keycloak
     ports:
      - "8787:8787"
     environment:
```

It overrides the keycloak of the base image with the one built on the local machine.

Then run the FAPI Conformance Suite with KEYCLOAK_REALM_IMPORT_FILENAME env var:

```
KEYCLOAK_REALM_IMPORT_FILENAME=realm-local.json docker-compose -p keycloak-fapi up --build
```

## Run FAPI Conformance test with persistent OpenID Server DB volume

Running this test suite does not require a persistent storage volume for MongoDB. The main benefit of
using persistent volume storage is that the OpenID Conformance Suite will remember the last test plan
config you used, allowing for easier and faster manual test operation. If you wish to enable persistent volume storage for the MongoDB container, uncomment 
the following lines in ./docker-compose.yml

```
...
#    volumes:
#     - mongodata:/data/db
...
#volumes:
#  mongodata:
```



## Custom files in the conformance suite

The conformance-suite folder within this repository is a local copy of OpenIds FAPI conformance suite (https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/).
Incorporating the suite and running the conformance tests within docker-compose requires adding custom files into the base OpenId FAPI conformance suite.
Below is a list of the custom files currently used by the base conformance-suite.
* /conformance-suite/run-tests.sh
  * Script for running / creating test plans
* /conformance-suite/Dockerfile
  * Dockerfile which installs python dependencies, exposes ports and kicks off building the project via the server-entrypoint script 
* /conformance-suite/server-entrypoint.sh
  * Script for building the project with maven
* /conformance-suite/scripts/run-test-plan.py
  * Existing file within the base conformance-suite repo that has been slightly modified to output test results to the file system.


**Running different test plans**

To create custom test plans, add code into /conformance-suite/run-tests.sh as per commented out examples.
JSON configuration files for test plans should be created in /conformance-suite/.gitlab-ci/
